# Project Y

Personal gratification project for myself by creating a software that can streamline data entry my previous role as a legal assistant in immigraiton. 

## Pain Point

USCIS almost only mails out paper documents. Dealing with 2-3 bins of mail per day is not easy.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to upload and store notices and their data.
* As a user, I want to view, edit and delete immigration data.
* As a user, I want to create accounts and add people to that account.
* As a user, I want the process to be as efficient as possible.




## How to start

* bin/dev for server
* rails sample_data for sample data
* Tested on codespace
